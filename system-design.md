Generic Optimization Strategies
1.	Batch processing: Reduce overhead by grouping tasks.
2.	Caching: Use distributed caching for frequently accessed data.
3.	Load Balancing: Distribute workloads evenly among workers.
4.	Regional Scaling: Divide tasks by geographic regions for better latency and fault tolerance.
5.	Prioritization: Process critical tasks first.
