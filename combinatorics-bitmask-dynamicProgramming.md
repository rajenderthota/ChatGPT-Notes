There are 100 different types of caps each having a unique id from 1 to 100. also , there are 'n' persons each having a collection of a variable number of caps. One day all of these persons decide to go in a party wearning a cap but to look unique they decide that none of them will wear the same type of cap. so count the total number of arrangements or ways such that none of them is wearing the same type of cap.

This is a classic **combinatorics + bitmask + dynamic programming** problem. You are asked to compute the total number of valid assignments of **caps to people** such that:

* Each person wears **only one cap**.
* No two people wear the **same cap**.
* Each person has their own **list of cap preferences**.

---

### ðŸ§  Key Idea:

We solve this by:

* Representing each **state** by a bitmask of which persons have been assigned caps.
* Iterating cap by cap (1 to 100), and for each cap, trying to assign it to any person who wants it and hasn't got one yet.

### âœ… Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class UniqueCapAssignments {
    static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    static int[][] dp = new int[101][1 << 11]; // max 10 persons -> 2^10 possible masks
    static List<Integer>[] capList = new ArrayList[101];

    static int countWaysUtil(int cap, int mask, int allMask, int n) {
        if (mask == allMask) return 1; // all persons have caps
        if (cap > 100) return 0; // no more caps to assign
        if (dp[cap][mask] != -1) return dp[cap][mask];

        // Skip this cap
        long ways = countWaysUtil(cap + 1, mask, allMask, n);

        // Try assigning cap to anyone who wants it and is not assigned
        for (int person : capList[cap]) {
            if ((mask & (1 << person)) == 0) {
                ways += countWaysUtil(cap + 1, mask | (1 << person), allMask, n);
                ways %= MOD;
            }
        }

        return dp[cap][mask] = (int) ways;
    }

    static int countWays(List<List<Integer>> personCaps, int n) {
        // Initialize capList
        for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
            capList[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int person = 0; person < n; person++) {
            for (int cap : personCaps.get(person)) {
                capList[cap].add(person);
            }
        }

        for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        int allMask = (1 << n) - 1; // all persons assigned

        return countWaysUtil(1, 0, allMask, n);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example: 3 persons
        List<List<Integer>> personCaps = new ArrayList<>();
        personCaps.add(Arrays.asList(5, 100, 1));
        personCaps.add(Arrays.asList(2, 100, 3));
        personCaps.add(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 4));

        int ways = countWays(personCaps, personCaps.size());
        System.out.println("Total ways to assign caps uniquely: " + ways);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:

* This works efficiently up to **n = 10 persons** due to `2^n` states.
* `capList[i]` contains all persons who like cap `i`.
* `dp[cap][mask]` stores number of ways to assign caps starting from `cap` given current assignment state `mask`.
